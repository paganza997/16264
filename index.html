    <h1>Real time Edge Detection</h1>
    <p>The sensor that I used for this assignment was my computer webcam and
        used MATLAB to implement the edge detection.
    </p>
    <h3>Setting it up</h3>
    <p>
        You will need to download two add-ons from MATLAB.<br>
        When in the Home tab of MATLAB, navigate to the Add-Ons button on the right.
        Search for "webcams" in the search bar. You will need to download the 
        "MATLAB Support Package for USB Webcams" and "Image Acquisition Toolbox 
        Support Package for OS Generic Video Interface" packages.
    </p>

    <p>To make sure things are working, you can type "webcamlist" into the
        Command Window of MATLAB. You should get a list of all webcams 
        connected to your computer.
    </p>
    <h3>The Code</h3>
    <p>The code for this isn't too involved. The snapshot function grabs a single image
        from the webcam and the imshow() displays that image. We can then implement the
        edge detection.<br>
        First, we convert the image to gray scale with rgb2gray(). We then add some 
        thresholding to get rid of all the noise that will appear. Then, use the built-in
        function edge() along with the 'canny' parameter (which uses the Canny Method to do the edge detection part).<br>
        All of this is occuring in a while loop so the program is continually taking an
        image and applying the edge detection.
